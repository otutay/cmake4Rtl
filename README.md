# cmake4Rtl
cmake trial for rtl development
Basically search the given directories and creates a vivado project.
Super handy for github as Vivado xpr gets conflict every time 2 member adds new files to the project.
synth and simulation support will be added as i need them. 
let the cmake create the vivado projects.
